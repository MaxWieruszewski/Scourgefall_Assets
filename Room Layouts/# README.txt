Room layouts:
- Any size is okay, but preferably do not make them too big
- Default size of a room: 29 pixels wide and 12 pixels high
	- Any other are also okay. Minimum is 4x4 technically
- Just make an image with the intended size and paint it
	- Black = Tile
	- White = Empty Space
- Colors have to be fully white or fully black. Nothing in between


Add as many as you can think of)
