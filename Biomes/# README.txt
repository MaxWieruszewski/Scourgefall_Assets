Regarding TileMaps:
The 6 tiles in the bottom left are just copies of the corner/ side pieces from the top left. 
Just some pixels on the sides have been filled in for where the platforms will connect to the wall.
Like thise there wont be weird holes where the platforms connect to sides of other tiles but maybe its not necessary.

Leave the bootom left 6 Tiles out if you want. I can adjust it accordingly in the end)
